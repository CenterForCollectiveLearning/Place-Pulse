      <h2 class="hextra">The Project</h2>
      <p>Imagine traveling through a strange city. Inside your mind, subconscious judgements about your surroundings are made in real time. Do you feel safe? Does the area you are in seem unique? Does it appear wealthy, clean or even energetic? You may not think about, let alone understand, what goes into making these anecdotal determinations, but when elicited, your opinions can be understood as part of a more substantial collective and used in powerful ways.</p>
      <p>In 1960, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_A._Lynch">Kevin Lynch</a> published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Image-Harvard-MIT-Joint-Center-Studies/dp/0262620014">"The Image of the City"</a> and established how people perceive and create mental models of the cities they inhabit. Since then, the fields of both architecture and urban planning have heavily studied urban perception, placing emphasis on everything from the macro scale of a city to the intricate details of an individual building. Institutional limitations, however, have limited the throughput of urban perception studies by constraining the quantity of both images and subjects used.</p>
      <p>To mitigate these past limitations, we present Place Pulse. Place Pulse is a website that allows anybody to quickly run a perception study and visualize the results in powerful ways. Developed at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a> by the <a href="http://macroconnections.media.mit.edu">Macro Connections group</a>, Place Pulse crowdsources surveys to internet participants, asking binary perception questions across a large number of geotagged images. From the responses of each participant, directed graphs are generated, which are then layered with the graphs of others, forming what we call a perception network. This perception network can be analyzed and visualized in a multitude of ways, allowing the experimenter to identify interesting patterns in the data, possibly forming the basis for a future hypothesis.</p>

      <h2 class="hextra">Macro Connections</h2>
      <p>At the Media Lab, the future is built, not imagined. In a world where radical technology advances are taken for granted, Media Lab researchers design technologies for people to create a better future.</p>
      <p>The way we act, both individually and collectively, depends strongly on the way we see the world. The Macro Connections group focuses on the development of analytical tools that can help improve our understanding of the world’s macro structures in all of their complexity. By developing methods to analyze and represent networks—such as the networks connecting countries to the products they export, or historical characters to their peers—Macro Connections research aims to help improve our understanding of the world by putting together the pieces that our scientific disciplines have pulled apart.</p>
